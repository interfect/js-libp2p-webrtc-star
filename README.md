> libp2p WebRTC transport that includes a discovery mechanism provided by the signalling-star

## Description

`libp2p-webrtc-star` is one of the WebRTC transports available for libp2p. `libp2p-webrtc-star incorporates both a transport and a discovery service that is facilitated by the signalling server, also part of this module.

**Note:** This module uses [pull-streams](https://pull-stream.github.io) for all stream based interfaces.

## Example

```
TODO
```

## Installation

### npm

```sh
> npm i libp2p-webrtc-star
```

### This module uses `pull-streams`

We expose a streaming interface based on `pull-streams`, rather then on the Node.js core streams implementation (aka Node.js streams). `pull-streams` offers us a better mechanism for error handling and flow control guarantees. If you would like to know more about why we did this, see the discussion at this [issue](https://github.com/ipfs/js-ipfs/issues/362).

You can learn more about pull-streams at:

- [pull-streams documentation](https://pull-stream.github.io/)

#### Converting `pull-streams` to Node.js Streams

If you are a Node.js streams user, you can convert a pull-stream to a Node.js stream using the module [`pull-stream-to-stream`](https://github.com/pull-stream/pull-stream-to-stream), giving you an instance of a Node.js stream that is linked to the pull-stream. For example:

```js
const pullToStream = require('pull-stream-to-stream')

const nodeStreamInstance = pullToStream(pullStreamInstance)
// nodeStreamInstance is an instance of a Node.js Stream
```
